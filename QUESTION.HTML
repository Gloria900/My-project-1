is HTML, and why is it important in web development?
•	HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
•	It provides the basic structure of web pages using elements (tags) like <h1>, <p>, <img>, etc.
•	Importance:
•	Without HTML, there would be no structure for web browsers to display content.
•	It defines headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, etc.


2. What is the difference between an id and a class in HTML?
•	id:
•	Uniquely identifies a single element.
Example 
•	Syntax: id="uniqueName".
<div id="header"></div>

•	Only one element on the page can have a specific ID.

•	class:
•	Defines a group of elements with the same styling or behavior.
•	Syntax: class="commonName".
Example:
<div class="card"></div>
<div class="card"></div>

•	Multiple elements can share the same class.

Summary:
•	Use id for unique elements.
•	Use class for grouping elements.



3. What are semantic HTML elements, and why are they important?
•	Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and developers.
•	Examples: <article>, <section>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>.
•	Importance:
•	Makes code easier to read and maintain.
•	Improves SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
•	Enhances accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies.
4. Explain the concept of the DOM (Document Object Model).
•	The DOM is a programming interface for web documents.
•	It represents the page as a tree-like structure of objects (nodes).
•	When you load a web page, the browser turns HTML into a DOM.
•	Each tag becomes a node in the tree.
•	JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM (add, remove, or change elements).

Example:
HTML:
<p>Hello World</p>

DOM:
Document
└── html
  └── body
      └── p
          └── "Hello World"
          5. What is the purpose of the <meta> tag in HTML?
          •	The <meta> tag provides metadata (information about the webpage) for browsers and search engines.
          •	Common uses:
          •	Character encoding:
      
      HTML:
      
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      
      Defines the character set.
      
          •	SEO description:
      html:
      
      <meta name="description" content="A simple webpage about HTML.">
      
      Used by search engines for page summaries.
      
          •	Responsive Design:
          html:
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
          
          Makes the page Mobile friendly.
          
          6. How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?
              •	A hyperlink is created with the <a> (anchor) tag and the href attribute.
          
          .
          
          Example:
          <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
          href defines the URL or destination of the link.
          
          7. What is the difference between inline, block, and inline-block elements in HTML?
              •	Block elements:
              •	Take up the full width.
              •	Always start on a new line.
              •	Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>.
              •	Inline elements:
              •	Take up only as much width as needed.
              •	Do not start a new line.
              •	Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>.
              •	Inline-block elements:
              •	Behave like inline (sit side-by-side).
              •	Allow setting width and height (unlike pure inline elements).
              Examples:
              html
              <span>Inline</span> 
              <div>Block</div> 
              <span style="display:inline-block; width:100px;">Inline-Block</span>
              
              
              8. What is the <form> tag used for in HTML?
                  •	The <form> tag is used to collect user input.
                  •	It wraps form elements like:
                  •	<input>, <textarea>, <button>, <select>, etc.
                  •	Action attribute: where to send form data.
                  •	Method attribute: how to send data (GET or POST).
              
              Example:
              
              html
              <form action="/submit" method="post">
                <input type="text" name="username">
                <button type="submit">Submit</button>
              </form>
              
              
              9. What is the box model in CSS, and what are its components?
                  •	The CSS Box Model is how every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box.
                  •	It consists of 4 main parts (from inside out):
                  1.	Content: The text, image, or data inside the box.
                  2.	Padding: Space inside the box, around the content.
                  3.	Border: The line surrounding padding (and content).
                  4.	Margin: Space outside the border, separating it from other elements.
              
              Example:
              
              css
              div {
                width: 200px;
                padding: 20px;
                border: 5px solid black;
                margin: 10px;
              }
              10. Explain the difference between padding and margin in CSS.
              •	Padding:
              •	Space inside an element, between content and border.
              •	Increases the size of the element.
              •	Margin:
              •	Space outside the element’s border.
              •	Creates gaps between elements.
          
          Example:
          css:
          div {
            padding: 20px; /* pushes content inward */
            margin: 20px;  /* pushes element away from others */
          }
          
              •	Padding = inside the box.
              •	Margin = outside the box.
          
              11. What are CSS selectors, and how do they work?

              CSS selectors are patterns used to select HTML elements so styles can be applied to them.
              
              Types of selectors:
                  1.	Element Selector
                  •	Targets elements by name.
              
              Example:
              
              p {
                color: blue;
              }
              
              Applies to all <p> tags.
              
                  2.	Class Selector
                  •	Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
                  •	Syntax: starts with a dot (.).
                  •	Example:
              .highlight {
                background-color: yellow;
              }
                  3.	ID Selector
                  •	Targets a single element with a specific id attribute.
                  •	Syntax: starts with a hash (#).
              Example :
              
              #main-title {
                font-size: 24px;
              }
                  4.	Attribute Selector
                  •	Targets elements based on their attributes.
              
              Example:
              input[type="text"] {
                border: 1px solid gray;
              }
              
                  5.	Universal Selector
                  •	Targets all elements.
                  •	Example:
              * {
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;
              }
              
                  6.	Group Selector
                  •	Applies styles to multiple selectors.
                  •	Example:
              
              h1, h2, h3 {
                font-family: Arial;
              }
                  7.	Descendant Selector
                  •	Targets elements inside a specific element.
              Example:
              div p {
                color: green;
              }      
              12. What is Flexbox, and how does it work in CSS?

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is used to build 1-dimensional layouts, arranging items in a row or column with dynamic spacing and alignment.

How to use:

Set a container to use Flexbox:             
.container {
display: flex;
}
Main Properties:
•	flex-direction
•	Sets the main axis (row or column).
•	Values: row (default), row-reverse, column, column-reverse.
Example:
flex-direction: row;
•	justify-content
•	Aligns items horizontally (main axis).
•	Values: flex-start, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.
Example:
justify-content: center;
•	align-items
•	Aligns items vertically (cross axis).
•	Values: flex-start, center, flex-end, stretch.
Example :
align-items: center;
Example:

.container {
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
justify-content: space-between;
align-items: center;
}
13. What is the difference between position: relative and position: absolute in CSS?

position: relative
•	Moves an element relative to its original position.
•	The space it occupied remains.
•	Useful for slightly offsetting elements.
Example 

.box {
position: relative;
top: 10px; /* moves down 10px */
left: 20px; /* moves right 20px */
}

position: absolute
•	Removes the element from the normal flow.
•	Positions it relative to the nearest ancestor with position set (relative, absolute, or fixed).
•	If no such ancestor exists, it positions relative to the <body>.
Example:
.box {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
}
Comparison:

Property
relative
absolute
Keeps space in layout?
Yes
No
Relative to?
Itself
Nearest positioned ancestor
14. What is the purpose of media queries in CSS?

Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles based on:
•	Screen width
•	Device type (mobile, tablet, desktop)
•	Orientation (portrait or landscape)

They help make web pages responsive — adapting layout and design to different screen sizes.
Example:
/* For devices smaller than or equal to 600px */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
body {
background-color: lightgray;
}
}

Common uses:
•	Resize fonts on smaller screens.
•	Stack columns instead of showing them side-by-side.
•	Hide/show certain content on different devices.

⸻

15. What is CSS Grid, and how does it differ from Flexbox?

CSS Grid is a 2D layout system (works with rows and columns), while Flexbox is 1D (either a row or column).

CSS Grid Example:
.container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* 3 equal columns */
gap: 20px;
}

Key properties:
•	grid-template-columns / grid-template-rows: define structure.
•	grid-column / grid-row: position children.
•	gap: space between grid items.

16. What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS?

Pseudo-classes:

Target elements based on user interaction or position/state.

Example:

a:hover {
color: red; /* when mouse hovers */
}

input:focus {
border-color: blue; /* when input is selected */
}

li:first-child {
font-weight: bold;
}

Pseudo-elements:

Target parts of an element, not the whole.

Examples:

p::first-line {
text-transform: uppercase;
}

p::first-letter {
font-size: 200%;
}

.card::before {
content: "→ ";
color: green;
}
17. What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

These three keywords are used to declare variables, but they differ in scope, hoisting, and mutability.

var
•	Function-scoped.
•	Can be redeclared.
•	Hoisted (moved to the top of its scope), but initialized as undefined.

function test() {
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
}

let
•	Block-scoped (limited to {} block).
•	Cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
•	Hoisted but not initialized (ReferenceError if accessed before declaration).

let x = 10;
{
let x = 5; // different x
console.log(x); // 5
}
console.log(x); // 10
const
•	Also block-scoped.
•	Must be initialized during declaration.
•	Cannot be reassigned, but if it’s an object/array, contents can be changed.

const name = "John";
// name = "Mike"; // Error

const person = { age: 30 };
person.age = 35; // Allowed
18. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

undefined
•	A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
•	Often automatically assigned by JavaScript.

let x;
console.log(x); // undefined

null
•	An intentional absence of any value.
•	Manually set by a developer to indicate “no value”.
let y = null;
console.log(y); // null
Feature
undefined
null
Type
undefined
object (quirk in JS)
Set by
JavaScript (default)
Developer (manually)
Meaning
Variable is declared but empty
Variable is intentionally empty


19. What are JavaScript functions, and how do you define one?

A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

1. Regular Function Declaration
function greet(name) {
return "Hello, " + name;
}
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice
2. ⁠Function Expression
const add = function (a, b) {
return a + b;
};
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
3. ⁠Arrow Function

Shorter syntax, does not have its own this.
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // 20

// With a block body:
const sayHi = name => {
return Hi, ${name};
};

20. What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?

The this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the function. Its value depends on how the function is called.

In a regular function (non-strict mode):
function show() {
console.log(this);
}
show(); // In browser: Window object

Inside an object method:

const user = {
name: "Alice",
greet() {
console.log(this.name);
}
};
user.greet(); // Alice

Arrow functions:
•	Do not bind this; they inherit it from the parent scope.
const obj = {
name: "Bob",
greet: () => {
console.log(this.name);
}
};
obj.greet(); // undefined (because this is not obj)

In event handlers (DOM):
<button onclick="alert(this.innerText)">Click me</button>

Here, this refers to the button element that was clicked.
